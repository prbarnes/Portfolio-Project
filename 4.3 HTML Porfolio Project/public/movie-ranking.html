<h1>All The Best Movies According to P.J. Da Don</h1>
<hr />

<h3>Boys In Da Hood</h3>
<p>
   I like this movie becuase it depicts life in most poverty stricken uban areas. The movie has an excellent cast of characters consisting of mostly African American actors and actresses. These persons do an excellent job of bringing the story to life
</p>

<h3>A Bronx Tale</h3>
<p>
This is a classic movie in the sense it takes on several tough topics of the time. There is the issue with a working class fater trying to keep his teenage son out of trouble and away from the alluring mobster lifestyle. At the same time this addresses the issue of interracial dating in the time. This too is a classic
</p>

<h3>Lion King</h3>
<p>
I mean, who doesn't like Timon and Pumba. What else needs to be said about this movie?
</p>

<h3>Transformers (All o 'Em)</h3>
<p>
It's more than meets the eye. These movies are a great transistion for those of us that grew up reading comic books and watching the cartoons. They captivate a new generation of fans
</p>

<h3>A Knight's Tale</h3>
<p>
What a great story of perserverance, love, and triumph. I can watch this any time.
